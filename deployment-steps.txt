Step 1: Install Git
- Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Run the installer and use all default options
- Restart your PowerShell/command prompt after installation

Step 2: Run these Git commands in PowerShell (copy/paste each line)
  git config --global user.name "sdsasdadd23242"
  git config --global user.email "baldosjss@gmail.com"
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git remote add origin https://github.com/sdsasdadd23242/built-by-jack.git
  git push -u origin main

Step 3: When prompted for GitHub authentication
- Enter your GitHub username: sdsasdadd23242
- For password: use a personal access token (not your regular password)
- To create a token: https://github.com/settings/tokens → "Generate new token"
- Give it "repo" permissions and copy the token for use as your password

Step 4: Deploy on Netlify
- Go to: https://app.netlify.com/
- Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
- Choose GitHub and select "built-by-jack" repository
- Build command: npm run build
- Publish directory: out
- Click "Deploy site"

Your site will be deployed with a Netlify URL like: something.netlify.app
You can later set up a custom domain if you want.
